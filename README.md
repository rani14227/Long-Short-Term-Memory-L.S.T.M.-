# Long-Short-Term-Memory-L.S.T.M.-
This repository implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based deep learning model for time series forecasting. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization modules to predict future values based on historical data. The project can be adapted for financial forecasting, or any sequential data analysis task.
